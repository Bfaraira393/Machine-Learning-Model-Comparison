# Machine-Learning-Model-Comparison
A machine learning model comparison program which uses a data set of credit card transactions to train models.

There are no specific instructions needed to run this program, besides making sure the creditcard.csv file is in the same folder as the program. 
I ran it in visual studio code, but it should work fine in juptyer notebook. The recall score is the main accuracy metric that I used to compare the models. 
I also included confusion matrices for each model to show how accurate the models are.
